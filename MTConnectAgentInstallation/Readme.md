MTConnect Agent Installation
========================

Uses NSIS instsallation package to bundle deployment package.

Determines if 32 or 64 architecture to load correct agent.

Has NSIS screens to help configure SHDR adapters that agent will read.

Works well, but not sure about uninstall of all features installed 
(e.g., visual studio C++ 10.0 redistributable package.)
